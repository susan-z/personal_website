# About

<p style="float: right; width: 65%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> Hello! I am currently a Senior studying mechanical engineering with a minor in computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. My hometown is Edison, NJ -a place that is rich in cultures and is the perfect midpoint between NYC and Philadelphia. I've grown up with a love for volleyball, doodling, pilates, horror movies and trying out new restaurants. </p>

<p style="float: right; width: 65%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> Currently, I am part of UPenn's intramural volleyball team, Alpha Delta Pi, West Philly Swingers, and Yalla, a premiere bellydancing and drum troupe. I bolster my knowledge in mechanical engineering with computer science, electrical engineering, and bioengineering experience. With so much experience in multidisciplary projects, I am constantly being exposed to new and developing ideas.</p>
