Hello! I am currently a Junior studying mechanical engineering with a minor in computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. My hometown is Edison, NJ -a place that is rich in cultures and is the perfect midpoint between NYC and Philadelphia. I've grown up with a love for volleyball, doodling, pilates, horror movies and trying out new restaurants. 

<br/>

<p>Ever since entering college, I have not only connected with others with the same interests but found new ones along the way. I am part of UPenn's intramural volleyball team as well as their premiere bellydancing and drum troup and a proud member of Alpha Delta Pi. However I find my greatest source of inspiration from my fellow engineering classmates and teachers. I bolster my knowledge in mechanical engineering with computer science, electrical engineering, and bioengineering experience. By understanding differing fields as well as their overlaps, I am constantly being exposed to new and developing ideas. Listed below you will find a few of the classes and experiences that have impacted me the most, alongside relevant projects. </p>

<p>Please have a look around my website, and feel free to contact me via <a href="https://github.com/">LinkedIn</a> or by <a href="https://github.com/">email</a>. </p>
