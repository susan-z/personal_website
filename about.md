# About

<p style="float: right; width: 65%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Hello! I am currently a Senior studying mechanical engineering with a minor
in computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. My hometown is Edison, NJ
 -a place that is rich in cultures and is the perfect midpoint between NYC and
 Philadelphia. I've grown up with a love for volleyball, doodling, pilates,
 horror movies and trying out new restaurants. </p>

<p style="float: right; width: 65%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
<p>Currently, I am part of UPenn's intramural volleyball team, Alpha Delta Pi,
West Philly Swingers, and Yalla, a premiere bellydancing and drum troupe. I
bolster my knowledge in mechanical engineering with computer science, electrical
 engineering, and bioengineering experience. With so much experience in
 multidisciplary projects, I am constantly being exposed to new and developing ideas.</p>
