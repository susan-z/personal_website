# Mechanical Design
### MEAM 101: Introduction to Mechanical Design
This hands-on, project-based course covers the fundamentals of the modern mechanical design process, from basic need-finding through computerized manufacturing. Topics include: 
* Product definition: need-finding, observation, sketching, brainstorming, and prototyping
* Computer-aided design: part creation, assemblies, and animation using SolidWorks 
* Basic computer simulation and analysis
* Rapid prototyping: laser cutter and 3-d fused-deposition modeling
* General engineering design practices: materials, dimensioning, tolerances, etc.

### MEAM 247/248: Design Lab
These courses teach the principles of experimentation and measurement systems in concert with a number of mechanical design fundamentals. The fall semester follows closely with MEAM 210, doing experiments to explore the principles taught in statics and strength of materials, while the spring semester follows closely with MEAM 203 and MEAM 211 with hands-on design projects in thermodynamics and dynamics.

#### MEAM 247 Experience: 
* Material Properties: understanding of properties such as yield strength, ultimate strength, Young’s modulus, and
Poisson’s ratio when testing two bars of the same stock but of different lengths in an MTS machine
* Loading on Arches: force diagram of loading at the crown of an arch
* Trusses: labeling tension, compression, and zero force members
* Electronics: Robotic finger, nightlight

#### MEAM 248 Experience:
* Torque and RPM relationship: derby car design and construction with choice of motor with fixed gear ratio
* Filtering and angle of tilt analysis: use of accelerometers, and potentiometers to measure the angle of tilt on a plate while filtering out vibrations (linear accelerations of 1G) generated by a motorized system made out of Lego techinics
* Heat engine: creation of a fixed-working-fluid heat engine using a canister filled with air- to be heated and cooled -and a mechanism to store the work as gravitational potential energy
