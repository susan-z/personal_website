# Mechanical Design
### MEAM 101: Introduction to Mechanical Design
This hands-on, project-based course covers the fundamentals of the modern mechanical design process, from basic need-finding through computerized manufacturing. Topics include: product definition (need-finding, observation, sketching, brainstorming, and prototyping); computer-aided design (part creation, assemblies, and animation using SolidWorks 2013); basic computer simulation and analysis; rapid prototyping (laser cutter and 3-d fused-deposition modeling); and general engineering design practices (materials, dimensioning, tolerances, etc.).

### MEAM 247/248: Design Lab
These courses teach the principles of experimentation and measurement systems in concert with a number of mechanical design fundamentals. The fall semester follows closely with MEAM 210, doing experiments to explore the principles taught in statics and strength of materials, while the spring semester follows closely with MEAM 203 and MEAM 211 with hands-on design projects in thermodynamics and dynamics.
