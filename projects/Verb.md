# Verb Surgical

During my time at Verb, I have had significant experience with multiple stages of a product development cycle. This spans projects at the production level to developing tests for medical device validation and verification. My position as a systems integration engineer exposed me to complex subsystems where I greatly improved on my troubleshooting, debugging and root-cause analysis skills. As much of the product information is not public, the summaries of my projects will honor that confidentiality.

## Selected Projects
### Robotic Sugical Arm Control Characterization
