# Verb Surgical

During my time at Verb, I have had significant experience with multiple stages of a product development cycle. This spans projects at the production level to developing tests for medical device validation and verification. My position as a systems integration engineer exposed me to complex subsystems where I greatly improved on my troubleshooting, debugging and root-cause analysis skills. As much of the product information is not public, the summaries of my projects will honor that confidentiality.

## Selected Projects
### Robotic Sugical Arm Control Characterization
The purpose was to characterize the system performance against a system requirement. I worked with cross-functional teams to develop test protocols and gain alignment on metrics. By designing and prototyping fixtures, writing Python and Matlab test scripts, as well as purchasing qualified measurement devices, I produced repeatable, well-documented characterization tests. This in turn generated the quantitative data used to compare against qualitative user data and analytical approaches. Through this entire process, I maintained clear communication with the team, giving weekly updates and presenting data. This also became the basis of a reliability test, where the knowledge transfer was swift and easy due to my organization and protocols.
