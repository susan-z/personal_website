# Digital Electronics for the Inventor

This was a hands-on course led by Professor Yash Risbud at the Cooper Union School of Engineering. Topics included digital logic design, circuit theory, programmable devices, and basic microelectronics. Skills were first developed by building several circuits individually, and the course culminated with a final project built from scract, and performed in groups. 

Skills developed: 
* Understading of boolean algebra, flip-flops, counters, registers
* Digital logic design
* Design, prototyping, testing and demonstration of projects
* Protocol and functional testing
* Project managment
