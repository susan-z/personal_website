# Digital Electronics for the Inventor

Prof. Yash Risbud
Department of Electrical Engineering
Director, C.V. Starr Research Foundation

This hands-on course challenges you to assess, design, build, test, and demonstrate an electronics project from scratch.  Daily lecture topics include digital logic design, circuit theory, programmable devices, and basic microelectronics.  Students will work with diagnostic tools critical in creating a successful device of their own design.  Initial designs by the faculty will be used as demonstrations and practice experiments.  Student work culminates with an original design they create in small teams.  Each student will build several circuits individually, with the final projects performed in groups.  Students will develop your skills in project management, prototyping, protocol and functional testing, quality assurance, and device deployment.  It is highly recommended that students requesting this course already have beginner electronics and/or microcontroller background.

DIGITAL LOGIC DESIGN
Theoretical and practical issues concerning design with combinational and sequential logic circuits, and programmable logic devices. Number systems, Boolean algebra, representation and simplification o fBoolean functions, universal logic families. Finite-state machines, state tables and state diagrams, flip-flops, counters, registers. Adders, decoders, comparators, multiplexers, memories and applications. Programmable devices: PLA, PLD, etc. Principles of analog circuits are presented in the context of real world problems, such as 'glitches,' power and ground bounce, contact bounce, tri-state logic and bus interfacing, timing circuits, asynchronous versus synchronous circuit components. Characterization of electronic and logical properties of digital circuits. Course work involves individual and team projects in which: digital circuits are designed and prototypes are constructed and tested on breadboards; designs involving programmable logic devices are developed using CAD tools. The projects, approximately 50 percent of the course grade, are used to assess technical writing, oral presentation, teamwork and project management skills.
