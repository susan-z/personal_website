# Digital Electronics for the Inventor

This was a hands-on course led by Professor Yash Risbud at the Cooper Union School of Engineering. Topics included digital logic design, circuit theory, programmable devices, and basic microelectronics. Skills were first developed by building several circuits individually, and the course culminated with a final project built from scratch, and performed in groups. 

Skills developed: 
* Understading of boolean algebra, flip-flops, counters, registers
* Digital logic design
* Design, prototyping, testing and demonstration of projects
* AutoCAD, Arduino
* Project managment

### Final Project: Beemo
This project, affectionately named after a cartoon video game console called BMO, comprises two arcade-style games and a vending machine. The first game is a memory game with three levels, based off of the classic "Simon" game. This was completed using by writing code in Arduino C. Once the player successfully completed the memory game, the LED roulette wheel begins. This was done by solely using digital logic: a 555 timer and several shift registers.

Depending on where the player stopped the LED roulette, a servo motor would be activated and unlatch a door containing the candy identified on the roulette wheel. The MDF panels were designed using AutoCAD and then lasercut to be pressfit together.
