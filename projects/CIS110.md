# Computer Programming

CIS110: Introduction to Computer Programming teaches the fundamentals of computer programming in Java, with emphasis on applications in science and engineering. Through taking this course, I learned about the broader field of computer science and algorithmic thinking, the fundamental approach that computer scientists take to solving problems.

### Individual Projects
1. [The Great Race][https://github.com]
Creates a visualization of a race between two contestants.

Experience: 
* Animation and mouse input
* Declare, assign, and operate on variables
* Loops and conditionals

2. [NBody][github.com]
Creates a visual simulation showing the planets (Mercury through Mars) orbiting around the sun by using Newton's universal law of gravitation.

Experience:
* Understand a scientific computing application
* Build up complex results using a sequence of simple statements
* Reinforce understanding of animations
* Use nested loops
* Use arrays
* Use Java command-line arguments

3. [Cheat-Checker][github.com]
