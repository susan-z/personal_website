# Computer Programming

CIS110: Introduction to Computer Programming teaches the fundamentals of computer programming in Java, with emphasis on applications in science and engineering. Through taking this course, I learned about the broader field of computer science and algorithmic thinking, the fundamental approach that computer scientists take to solving problems.
