        <p>FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an international high school robotics competition. Each year, teams work during a six-week period to build game-playing robots. Team 2554, the War Hawks, is John P. Stevens High Schoolâ€™s FIRST Robotics team. Our team is divided into six separate sub-teams: Mechanical, Electrical, Programming, CAD, Marketing, and Safety. Although each individual group specializes in their field, all of the sub-teams come together to create a well-functioning robot for the competition.</p>

This was my first exposure to robotics. Upon joining, I became a part of the design team, utilizing Autodesk Inventor to assemble the chassis, motors, drive chains, shooters, and electrical components of the robot. Once a drive function verified the parts worked together, the design team worked alongside the mechanical sub-team to complete the physical construction. The following year I became the Admin president of the team, thus being responsible for a team of over 80 members and the marketing sector of the team. We were able to meet the $10,000 budget needed for the season through fundraising and sponsorships.
