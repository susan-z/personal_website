        <p>FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an international high school robotics competition. Each year, teams work during a six-week period to build game-playing robots. Team 2554, the War Hawks, is John P. Stevens High Schoolâ€™s FIRST Robotics team. Our team is divided into six separate sub-teams: Mechanical, Electrical, Programming, CAD, Marketing, and Safety. Although each individual group specializes in their field, all of the sub-teams come together to create a well-functioning robot for the competition.</p>

This was my first experience with robotics. 
design components such as drive chains, the chassis, and shooters. prototype and the physical construction of the robot. Students in this sub-team build the skeletal structure of the robot, and efficiently arrange the motors, electronics, and various mechanisms onto the robot.The Marketing team is in charge of all the behind-the-scenes work: every year they must carry out fundraisers, acquire sponsorship and grants to meet the yearly $10,000 budget needed for a successful season. They also market the team, reach out to the community, and make robotics stand out in our community.By utilizing Autodesk Inventor, students are able to assemble various extrusions, motors, and other parts. Once assembly is completed, the program allows the user to perform a drive function that demonstrates all the parts working together.
