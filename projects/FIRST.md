        <p>FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an international high school robotics competition. Each year, teams of high school students, coaches, and mentors work during a six-week period to build game-playing robots 
        Team 2554, the War Hawks, is John P. Stevens High Schoolâ€™s FIRST Robotics team. All FIRST participants seek to inspire new generations to explore the wonders of science and technology.
Every year, high school students have 6 weeks to design and build a robot that can complete the challenge and compete with teams from across the nation. Through the guidance and leadership of our captains and mentors, students are able to acquire the knowledge necessary and develop a powerful interest in STEM careers.
Our team is divided into six separate sub-teams: Mechanical, Electrical, Programming, CAD, Marketing, and Safety. Although each individual group specializes in their field, all of the sub-teams come together to create a well-functioning robot for the competition.</p>
