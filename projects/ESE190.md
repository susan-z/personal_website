# Silicon Garage

ESE190: Silicon Garage is a hands-on lab course about open source hardware and software platforms.  It explores Aruino and Raspberry Pi platforms as well as using the programming language, Processing, to interface the microcontrollers to sensors.

This course allowed me to become very comfortable using Arduino alongside sensors and various hardware components, and familiarized me with Raspberry Pi. Mini-projects that preceded the final pair project concerned many electrical parts: LEDs, pushbuttons, photocells, transistors (MOSFET), bluetooth and wifi modules, and OpAmps for filtering signals.

### Final Pair Project

For the final project, we decided to create a robotic arm with a gripper. There are four degrees of freedom, with one servo moter pivoting the base, another activating the gripper, and two other motors controlling the links. LED lights decorate the sides and have three modes: on, off, and blinking. The servo motors were controlled by an Arduino.
