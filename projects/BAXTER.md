# BAXTER
BAXTER is a robot created by Rethink Robotics to be a safe, flexible, affordable alternative to fixed automation. In the field of mobile therapy assistants, Baxter is a perfect candidate to act as a therapist to stroke survivors. The current study involving the Baxter robot involves three stages:  learning, demonstration, and teaching.  In the learning phase, Baxter is trained how to mimic a real-life therapist;  this is done by using Microsoft Kinect, which maps the kinematic configuration of the human to Baxter.  After the robot demonstrates what it has learned from the therapist, the robot ostensibly would be capable of giving the desired therapy to the patient. 

The manipulators on the Baxter robot (see below) are not appropriate for assisting human movements. I was tasked with designing a simple set of "hands" to allow Baxter to safely and effectively interact with a human patient.
