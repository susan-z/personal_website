# Mechatronics

## Final Project
The designing and building remote controlled robots to play a MOBA-inspired game in 4v4 teams.

The robot would be piloted through UDP connected controllers (also of our own design) and would fight using visual and audio cues, such as speakers and flashing lights.

Robot and Nexus status, health, and attacks were measured and constantly updated through UDP protocol communication with a central score keeping computer.

The first team to "destroy" the opposing team's Nexus would win the match.
