## FlipSide: Pixelated Design Board

Signage is an essential component to the marketing strategies, everyday operation, and brand of any business. A sign displays all vital information â€” leading business owners to seek out creative, attractive signs to draw attention and stand out against competition. FlipSide is an electromechanical design board tailored to those who desire an old-school, non-digital sign while maintaining the same level of web-based control and automation. The sign consists of a uniform array of pixels that can be individually altered. A carriage of five solenoids moves along a cartesian system, actuating relevant pixels to produce the desired words and message. Team FlipSide has a corporate sponsor, Oat Foundry, who specialize in split-flap displays. This modularized, pixelated design board will maintain a lower price point, <$5,000, than existing mechanical display boards which retail for over $40,000.

Team FlipSide is comprised of Edward Devlin, Shirley Dong, Michael Gigante, Charles Hussey, Madeline McGovern, and Susan Zhao and is advised by Professor Mark Yim.
