The objective was to design and build an RC robot to compete in a MOBA-inspired tournament. My team of four developed a small, lightweight robot with differential drive, capable of weaving through the constructed maze-like arena. Additional characteristics included:
* Communication through UDP connected controllers
* Frequency-sensing light detection
* Servo-controlled attack arms
* LED visual cues for health and attack

## Master Slave Teleoperation
The focus of this project was to create a two degree of freedom input and output device. The input device utilized hall sensors for position sensing, paired with continuous feedback and PID control to position the motors in the output device into the correct position. This allows for remote manipulation with devices of different scales.
