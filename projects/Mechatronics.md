<figcaption> Robot traversing the maze to reach the Nexus, lowering enemy health </figcaption>
The objective was to design and build an RC robot to compete in a MOBA-inspired tournament. My team of four developed a small, lightweight robot with differential drive, capable of weaving through the constructed maze-like arena. Additional characteristics included: communication through UDP connected controllers, frequency-sensing light detection, servo-controlled attack arms, and LED visual cues for health and attack.
