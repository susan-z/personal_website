# Electrical and Systems Engineering
## ESE215
ESE215: Electrical Circuits and Systems is a course beginning with basic electric circuit analysis techniques of linear circuits, then delving into 1st order and 2nd order circuits in both the time and frequency domains, frequency behavior of circuits and the use of transfer functions. Designing, building and experimenting with electrical and electronic circuits are performed in a hands-on weekly lab. 

### Final Pair Project

## ESE190
ESE190: Silicon Garage is a hands-on lab course about open source hardware and software platforms.  It explores Aruino and Raspberry Pi platforms as well as using the programming language, Processing, to interface the microcontrollers to sensors. Mini-projects that preceded the final pair project concerned many electrical parts: LEDs, pushbuttons, photocells, transistors (MOSFET), bluetooth and wifi modules, and OpAmps for filtering signals. 

### Final Pair Project

For the final project, we decided to create a robotic arm with a gripper. There are four degrees of freedom, with one servo moter pivoting the base, another activating the gripper, and two other motors controlling the links. LED lights decorate the sides and have three modes: on, off, and blinking. The servo motors were controlled by an Arduino.
